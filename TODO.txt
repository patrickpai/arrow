Add remaining Java expression classes:
  HALF_FLOAT,
  TIME32,
  TIME64,
  DECIMAL,
  LIST,
  STRUCT,
  SPARSE_UNION,
  DENSE_UNION,
  DICTIONARY,
  MAP,
  EXTENSION,
  FIXED_SIZE_LIST,
  DURATION,
  LARGE_LIST

Look into modifying Java struct array/vector names (currently c1, c2, ..)
to be more space efficient

Fix style checks and productionize all code
